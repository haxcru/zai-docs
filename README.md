## Contributing

All contributors and contributions are welcome! We are a friendly community, so
don't be shy. 😘

### Here's what you need to know:

These docs are generated with [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/), a zero-code
static site generator based on Next.js.

If that doesn't mean anything to you, don't worry!

Essentially, we just need to stick
markdown (`.md` or `.mdx`) files in the `pages` directory. Each subdirectory in the `pages`
directory becomes a subsection in the documentation:

```
.
├── pages
│   ├── _app.js
│   ├── index.mdx
│   └── some-subdirectory
│       ├── another-subdirectory
│       │   └── another-doc.md
│       └── some-doc.mdx
```
